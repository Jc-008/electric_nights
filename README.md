# Electric Nights

## Project Overview
Electric Nights is a clone of eventbrite.com that themed on connecting people to EDM (Electronic Dance Music) events surrounding New York City. The goal and vision of the project was to have 2 fully functional MVP features finished to showcase and present. 

For future implementations, more features will be added to give greater interactivity for users.
